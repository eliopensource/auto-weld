# auto-weld
AutoWeld is a free, open-sourced plugin designed for making welding easier. Instead of making a Weld for each part in your tool, model, or anything else, you can simply weld everything at once with AutoWeld.

hehe stole the description from my devforum post


Find the code in code.lua
Find the gui in mainframe.rbxm

Find the plugin itself in autoweld.rbxm

Please do not reupload the plugin.
